# Techdegree Project 1
 My first TechDegree Project.

For this project, I created an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. 
The requirements for this project is basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops, conditionals and object literals to:
1. Build the array of quote objects to store the quotes
2. Write the functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.

This project is an effective way to practice basic JavaScript skills.

For this project, I went for the Extra Credit grade. To do so, I completed this requirements:
1. More properties to the quote object, for example, a tags property could include a list of tags like 'humor', 'business' and so on.
2. Random background color.
3. Auto-refersh the quote. After a certain amout of time, a new quote is displayed on the page.
